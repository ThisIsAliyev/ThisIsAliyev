## 👤 About
I’m a cybersecurity student training at the **Azerbaijan Cyber Security Center** while studying **Computer Engineering at Khazar University**.  
My focus is practical SOC work: understanding telemetry, investigating alerts, and improving detection & response through hands-on labs.

## 🎯 Focus Areas
- SOC workflow: alert → hypothesis → triage → investigation → decision
- Incident detection & response fundamentals
- Network defense basics
- Building lab environments to simulate real attacks and analyze them from a defender’s perspective

## 🧰 Tools & Practice
- SIEM: **Splunk**, **Wazuh**
- Network: **Wireshark**
- Windows basics: **Active Directory / Windows Server**
- Platforms: **TryHackMe**, **Hack The Box**, **LetsDefend**
- Linux & virtualization (hands-on learning)

## 🧾 Certifications
- **CNSP (Certified Network Security Practitioner)** — The SecOps Group
- **OpenEDR Fundamentals** — Xcitium

## 🕵️ Current Work
I’m building something in the background — details stay **surprise** for now.  
Progress will appear here as milestones land.
